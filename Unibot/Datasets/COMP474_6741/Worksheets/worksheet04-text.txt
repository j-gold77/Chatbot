COMP474/6741 Intelligent Systems (Winter 2022)Worksheet #4: Knowledge Base Design & ApplicationsTask 1. Quick refresher: How do you select all triples in a graph using SPARQL?SELECT . . .WHERE {. . .}Task 2. Now for something slightly different: Can you write a SPARQL query that selects all theproperties that were declared in a graph?PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>SELECT DISTINCT ?propertyWHERE {. . .}This is an example for a query that’s useful during knowledge base development, to show or test themetadata of a graph.Task 3. Find the URI for Meat Loaf (the musician, not the dish) in both DBpedia and Wikidata.ÏWhat’s a major difference between the two graphs? And what is the technical reason for it?Task 4. Wikidata also has a public SPARQL query interface, located at https://query.wikidata.org/.ÏYou previously found the URI for Concordia in Wikidata. Now, try to write a SPARQL query thatreturns the city (URI, name) for Concordia from Wikidata:SELECT ?city ?citynameWHERE {. . .}https://query.wikidata.org/COMP474/6741 Worksheet: Knowledge Base Design & Applications Winter 2022Task 5. Create a competency question and a corresponding SPARQL query for our FOCU universityexample:Testing query:SELECT . . .WHERE {. . .}Task 6. An early, well-known commercial service for semantic annotation of textual (mostly news)Ïdocuments was Thompson Reuter’s OpenCalais, which has since been spun out and re-branded asRefinitif Intelligent Tagging : Try out the online demo at https://permid.org/onecalaisViewer on adocument, for example the first part of the Wikipedia article on Concordia. Look at the entities thatwere detected and go to the “RDF view”: what ID is given to Concordia in this knowledge graph?Hint: There is another tool at the top of the page, Entity Search, where you can cross-check yourentities.Task 7. Go to the DBpedia Spotlight online demo at https://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org/demo/. TryÏanalyzing a test document with some ambiguities, e.g, “Paris Hilton went to the Hilton in Paris.”Inspect the entities that were linked to DBpedia. Are they correct?Task 8. Using Google’s Structured Data Testing Tools,1 examine your favorite movie on IMDB.2Ï1. Find some vocabulary terms that are used to model the movie information:2. Find the corresponding vocabulary definition URL online:Task 9. Find an article online, let’s say from the always trustworthy Mtl Blog.3 Look at the HTMLÏsource in your browser and find the META tags. Identify entries used by Facebook’s Open Graph Protocol.Now try running the same article through W3C’s RDFa 1.1 Distiller and Parser at https://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/. Choose Turtle format and compare the triples linking the article using Facebook’sOGP.1https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool2https://www.imdb.com3https://www.mtlblog.comhttps://permid.org/onecalaisViewerhttps://www.dbpedia-spotlight.org/demo/https://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/https://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-toolhttps://www.imdb.comhttps://www.mtlblog.com
