COMP 474/6741 Intelligent Systems (Winter 2022)Worksheet #6: Introduction to Machine LearningTask 1. A quick refresher: Based on the output below, compute precision@k = 1k·k∑c=1rel(c) for the threerecommender systems (for k = 1, 2, 3):System@k precision@k1 2 3 1 2 3system 1 7 7 3system 2 7 3 3system 3 3 3 3Task 2. Here is a dataset of documents with two attributes, to be grouped into two clusters. Applyk-Means clustering, by computing the Euclidian distance d(~p, ~q) =√∑ni=1(pi − qi)2 of each data point tothe two initial centröıds and assigning each document to its closest cluster:Centröıda1 a2Cluster 1 1.0 1.0Cluster 2 5.0 7.0a1 a2 Distance to C1 Distance to C2 Cluster TagDoc1 1.5 2.0 #TravelDoc2 3.0 4.0 #FoodDoc3 4.5 5.0 #TravelDoc4 3.5 4.5 #Food(Ignore the “Tag” column for now, we’ll use it in the next question!)Task 3. Now apply the kNN classification algorithm on the new document below to determine its tag. Usek = 3 and the Euclidian distance d(~p, ~q) =√∑ni=1(pi − qi)2 (just like for k-Means-clustering):a1 a2 d-Doc1 d-Doc2 d-Doc3 d-Doc4 Tag?Doc5 2.5 3.5You can now auto-assign a tag to the new document based on a majority vote of the k nearest neighbors.COMP474/6741 Worksheet: Introduction to ML Winter 2022Task 4. Should we invest $100m in producing this new movie? We’ll use machine learning to predict therating (1–5 stars) of a movie, by applying the regression version of the kNN algorithm. Here’s our trainingdata:# Movie Length #Zombies #Explosions Rating1 Movie 1 135 0 5 FFF2 Movie 2 90 123 2 FFFFF3 Movie 3 159 2 1 F4 Movie 4 109 5 3To find the predicted rating for Movie #4, first find the two nearest neighbors (i.e., k = 2), using the samecalculation as before:d( ~m4, ~m1) = d( ~m4, ~m2) = d( ~m4, ~m3) = =⇒ Closest = ,Now, compute the average of the ratings of the k nearest movies for k = 2 (convert the ? rating into a valuein [1...5]): This is your predicted rating for Movie 4!Task 5. Here are three different systems that classified 500 data items:Last time, we already calculated Precision and Recall for these systes (you can verify that the alternativeformulas here give you the same results). Now, compute the Accuracy and F1-Measure:Accuracy =TP + TNP + NRecall =TPTP + FNPrecision =TPTP + FPF1 =2 · Precision · RecallPrecision + Recallsystem 1 system 2 system 3Precision n/a 1.0 0.71Recall 0 0.6 1.0AccuracyF1-Measure
