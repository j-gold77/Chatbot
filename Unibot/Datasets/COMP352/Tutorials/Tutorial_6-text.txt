Every node has at most 2 children2. Each child node is labeled as being either a left child or a right child.3. A left child precedes a right child in the ordering of children of a node.A binary tree is proper (also referred to as full binary tree) if each node has either zero or two children. Thus, in a proper binary tree, every internal node has exactly two children. A binary tree that is not proper is improper.3BINARY TREES -ADDITIONAL METHODSA Binary Tree supports the following 4 accessor methods in addition to the regular Tree methods: left(v): Return the left child of v; an error condition occurs if v has no left child. right(v): Return the right child of v; an error condition occurs if v has no right child. hasLeft(v): Test whether v has a left child. hasRight(v): Test whether v has a right child.4BINARY TREES –PROPERTIES & IMPLEMENTATIONSIn a Binary Tree, every level d has at most 2^d nodes (the rest of the properties on p.303)Linked structure implementation & performance (p.305)Array list representation (p.314) 5BINARY TREES -ADDITIONAL TRAVERSAL ALGORITHMSBinary Tree-specific traversal algorithms: The inorder traversal, informally viewed as visiting the nodes from left to right. The Euler Tour Traversal, informally described as a “walk around” the tree, where every node is traversed 3 times (on the left, from below, and on the right)6PROBLEM SOLVING –QUESTION 1Draw an arithmetic expression tree that has four external nodes, storing the numbers 1, 5, 6, and 7 (with each number stored in a distinct external node, but not necessarily in this order), and has three internal nodes, each storing an operator from the set { + , − , ×, /}, so that the value of the root is 21. The operators may return and act on fractions, and an operator may be used more than once.7PROBLEM SOLVING –QUESTION 2Draw a (single) binary tree T such that: Each internal node of T stores a single character A preorder traversal of T yields EXAMFUN An inorder traversal of T yields MAFXUEN.8PROBLEM SOLVING –QUESTION 3 Draw a Binary Search Tree that shows the result of the tree after inserting the following keys (from left to right): The tree initially is empty.key ={17, 9, 26, 12, 11, 7, 30, 20, 21, 10}9PROBLEM SOLVING –QUESTION 4Describe, in pseudo-code, a nonrecursive method for performing an in-order traversal of a binary tree in linear time.10	Comp 352 – Fall 2021	Session Outline	Binary Trees -�Definitions 	Binary Trees -�Additional Methods	Binary Trees –�Properties & Implementations	Binary Trees -�Additional Traversal Algorithms	Problem Solving –�Question 1	Problem Solving –�Question 2	Problem Solving –�Question 3	Problem Solving –�Question 4
