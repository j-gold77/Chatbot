These work as a final goal or a stopping point. One or more recursive cases, that solve a small part of the problem and then call the function again to solve the rest3QUICK OVERVIEW ON RECURSION -TYPES OF RECURSION Linear Recursion: Simplest form of recursion Only one recursive call is made per function call Tail Recursion: Same as Linear Recursion Recursive call must be the last operation if called4QUICK OVERVIEW ON RECURSION -TYPES OF RECURSIONQuestion 1:Does the following algorithm use tail recursion? Algorithm LinearSum(A, n)Input: An integer array A and an integer n≥1, such that Ahas at least n elementsOutput: The sum of the first n integers in Aif n = 1 then return A[0]else return LinearSum(A, n-1) + A[n-1]5QUICK OVERVIEW ON RECURSION -TYPES OF RECURSION Binary Recursion: Recursive cases call the function two more times Multiple Recursion: Generalization of binary recursion, with multiple recursive calls (more than 2 calls)6COMPLEXITY ANALYSISEXTRA EXERCISESQuestion 2:Consider the following code, n is data size, k is a constantfor (i=0; i<n; i=i+k)for(j=0; j<i; j++)sum[j] = j * sum[i];What is the big-O time complexity in terms of n? Show all necessary steps. 7RECURSIONEXERCISESQuestion 3:Give a recursive algorithm to compute the product of two positive integers, m and n, using only addition and subtraction.8RECURSIONEXERCISESQuestion 4:Describe a recursive algorithm for finding the maximum element in an array A of n elements.9RECURSIONEXERCISESQuestion 5:Given an array A of length n containing values in increasing order, write a recursive algorithm to find the first repeated pair of values if such a pair exists.10	Comp 352	Session Outline	Quick Overview on Recursion -�Definition	Quick Overview on Recursion -�Types of Recursion	Quick Overview on Recursion -�Types of Recursion	Quick Overview on Recursion -�Types of Recursion	Complexity Analysis�Extra Exercises	Recursion�Exercises	Recursion�Exercises	Recursion�Exercises
