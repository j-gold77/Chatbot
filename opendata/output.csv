*KEYB*

Data is the new gold mine. The more people interact with each other, be it through Facebook and Twitter, or platforms like Amazon, the more data is generated, collected and exploited. Unlike gold, the regulations around data are much more obscure. Does the data generated belong to those who produce them, or those who collect them? What about the ethics of using these data for commercial purposes? Some of these questions regarding the legal and ethical aspect of utilizing data have emerged given the significant commercialization of data in recent years. 

Another angle of AI research and commercialization that must be seriously considered is the ethical use of data. Companies that spearhead AI development, such as Google and Microsoft, recognize the importance of these implications and have incorporated new ethics roles into their organizations. As Montreal is an international leader of Ethical AI initiatives and development of talent, it is more important now than ever for industry professionals to be aware of international legal regulations, ethical aspects of AI, and data privacy associated with both public and private, current and future data-related initiatives. 
*CNT*
This training will enable you to:
?	Analyze international data protection laws in the US, Canada, Europe and China;
?	Evaluate and analyze the role of ethical and legal implications associated with the boom of international AI initiatives and the development of ethical principles in AI;

?	Discuss existing industry cases such as Facebook, Cambridge Analytica, Amazon, etc.
*APP*

In painting emerged a tendency to abstraction, in music a tendency to atonality, and in literature to non-mimetic forms. Experiments abounded in disjunctive, elliptical, impressionistic, allusive, and mythopoeic styles. Avant-garde artists organized into numerous schools, including the Imagists, Surrealists, Dadaists, Constructivists, Futurists, and Vorticists. The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the """"Jazz Age,"""" the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance. While the course focuses on the lively cross-fertilization of British and American writing, the international scope of Modernism is also emphasized, as well as its diversity (e.g. in ballet, cinema, music, and painting).""

Students work on a supervised team project to solve a complex interdisciplinary design
problem. The project is completed by a team of students from at least two different
departments in GCS. The project must provide clear goals for each discipline-specific task
and each student must have sufficient exposure to subjects in their program of study.
Student eligibility and project topics for this course are subject to approval by the ENGR
490 Design Committee, which includes a member from each department in GCS that
offers undergraduate programs. This committee vets each project to ensure the clarity and
scope of the goals and its relevance to the learning outcomes of students from each
discipline.
The project is carried out over both fall and winter terms. Students are expected to provide
a preliminary project proposal, a progress and a final report (as a group); take part in
group discussions in audit sessions during the design phase; and participate in a poster
session involving individual oral presentations at the end of the winter term. In addition to
the technical aspects, students are expected to learn how to evaluate their designs for
compliance to regulations, environmental and societal expectations and economic issues.
Students learn how to work in a multidisciplinary environment and receive exposure to
entrepreneurial skills. Lectures: one hour per week, two terms. Equivalent laboratory time:
three hours per week, two terms.

Given that graduate students investigate some of the most pressing issues in society, we must find ways to ensure that our work reaches the broader public. One way of doing this is to engage in op-ed writing. 

Op-eds are opinion pieces written on a newsworthy topic by someone that is unaffiliated with the newspaper. They enable you to bring your voice, expertise and authority on important issues to the greater public, in real-time.

In this 2-hour workshop we outline the key elements and strategies that contribute to writing powerful op-eds that journal editors will want to publish. First, we present the theory behind writing op-eds, including: what is an op-ed, what are news cycles, and how do the two fit together; the benefits of writing an op-ed; and analyze the components, structure, and style of an op-ed. During the second half of the session, participants will practice writing a news ?lede? and ?hook? (e.g., the key introductory components of an op-ed) that is relevant to their research field. 
~~~
After attending this workshop, participants will be able to:

1.	Understand the importance of writing op-eds as a grad student;
2.	Identify when and how to join a news conversation;
3.	Identify the key components of an op-ed and understand their functions;
4.	Understand and evaluate journalistic writing styles;
5.	Write an impactful news ?lede? and ?hook?;

For example, this workshop will offer writing tips to aid in the development of many standard and essential sections of the application (e.g. outline of proposed research, and other applicant statements). Funding agencies typically expect students to be the author of their own applications, but this does not mean writing in isolation ? and does not exclude the important contributions and feedback of peers, research supervisors and other mentors.  

Note: Students are ultimately responsible for ensuring their own applications conform to the instructions and standards laid out on by each agency for the specific funding program(s) they select.
~~~
After attending this workshop, participants will be able to: 
?	Identify peers to provide essential feedback on sections of the application, as well as the application as a whole.
?	Consider ways to benchmark against materials from previous scholarship winners.
?	Adapt their writing and presentation styles to present achievements in succinct and effective ways.

4619,37304,GPTK,701,Peer Instruction: Engaging Students in Small and Large Classrooms,2.0,WKS,Workshop,,PDEV,,"Peer instruction is a research-based pedagogy that actively engages students in the classroom and has been shown to dramatically improve conceptual understanding, even in large classes. The basic goals of peer instruction are to encourage and make use of student interaction during lectures, while focusing students' attention on underlying concepts and techniques. The method has been assessed in many studies using standardized, diagnostic tests and shown to be considerably more effective than the conventional lecture approach to teaching. Peer instruction is now used in a wide range of courses. In this workshop, participants will learn about peer instruction, serve as the &quot;class&quot; in which peer instruction is demonstrated, discuss several models for implementing the technique into the classroom, and learn about available teaching resources. While successfully implementing peer instruction doesn't require any technology, using the right technology can improve student engagement, increase learning, and make it easier to implement peer instruction in your classroom.

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to 
1. Articulate challenges in engaging students in lecture-based classes
2. Explain how Peer Instruction can be used to address identified challenges with student engagement

4669,50354,GPWL,978,Time Management,6.0,WKS,Workshop,,PDEV,,"We all want to make the most of our lives. We want to learn time management skills to work more effectively and efficiently. We want to be able to make time for what truly matters to us. But how?

As a leader in time management research, Brad Aeon has developed a 4-part workshop that will help you manage your time more meaningfully.

Based on over a decade of scientific research, his workshops have helped hundreds of people worldwide increase their personal productivity, health, happiness, and well-being. The four parts are:

1. Purpose. The first step in improving your time management skills is to determine what you really want out of life. You can't effectively manage time if you don't know how you want to spend it. After all, we all manage time for something. This session will help you figure out what that something is. Drawing on the latest research on purpose, meaning in life, motivation, and goal setting, this session will help you find a sense of purpose that inspires and energizes you.

2. Structure. Schedules, calendars, and to-do lists are all tools you can use to gain control of your time. But few people use these tools properly. We think we know how to use them, but in reality they are often more of a hindrance than a help. This session will teach you how to use time management tools effectively, so you can turn them into powerful allies rather than stubborn enemies.

3. Information. Social media, emails, texts, and other digital tools are the most obvious time wasters in our lives. They all compete for your attention. And whatever captures your attention also captures your time. If you want to have more time in the 21st century, you have to learn how to manage the information you receive. This session will teach you techniques to filter, organize, and sort information effectively, so that it works for you rather than against you.

4. Priorities. Most of us have more things that we want to do than time in which to do them. The only way out of this situation is to learn how to prioritize. This session will teach you how to take a step back, assess your life, and determine your most important goals, so you can focus your precious time on the things that really matter.

~~~
This workshop will help students improve their time management skills.
~~~

This workshop is led by Brad Aeon. Brad Aeon is obsessed with how people think about and use time. He did his PhD on the history, sociology, and psychology of time management. His TED Talk The Philosophy of Time Management invites people to reconsider their relationship with time from a fundamental and existential perspective. Brad?s research and ideas have been featured in top media outlets, including the Harvard Business Review, BBC News, and CBC. He has worked with numerous companies and nonprofits to help people feel more in control of their time using evidence-based, innovative strategies. Brad Aeon is also the founder and director of the Time Research Institute, a registered nonprofit dedicated to making time management accessible to vulnerable and underprivileged populations.",,,,,,
